# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 2025_

## Overview

**Hummingbird AI Agent** is a latency-aware trading research assistant developed by **Marinus Ukewuihe**.  
It analyzes trading latency between global financial hubs and may connect to external APIs hosted on Render for latency estimation and backtesting.

We respect your privacy. This document describes how data is handled when you interact with the Hummingbird AI Agent.

---

## Data Collection

- The Hummingbird AI Agent **does not collect, store, or share** any personally identifiable information (PII).
- All interactions take place within the OpenAI ChatGPT interface.  
- When API calls are made to the Render backend (`https://hummingbird-agent.onrender.com`), only **non-personal, task-related parameters** are transmitted — such as:
  - Geographic locations or data center identifiers (e.g., “Chicago”, “London”)
  - Model parameters (e.g., latency, Sharpe ratio, equity data)
  - Uploaded test data for simulation (if provided explicitly by the user)

No authentication data, account identifiers, or user messages are logged by the backend.

---

## Data Usage

- Data provided during interactions is used **solely to fulfill the user’s request** (for example, to estimate latency or run a backtest).  
- Any temporary computation results are discarded after the response is generated.  
- No analytics, marketing, or tracking systems are implemented.

---

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or share data with third parties.  
Render (the hosting provider) may log basic server metrics such as request counts and response times for infrastructure monitoring purposes. These logs do not include user-identifying information.

---

## Cookies and Tracking

The Hummingbird AI Agent does **not** use cookies, session storage, or browser-based tracking mechanisms.

---

## Your Control and Rights

Because the Agent does not store personal information, there is **no retained data to delete or export**.  
If you have privacy concerns, you can discontinue interaction at any time.

---

## Security

All API communication between OpenAI’s systems and the Render backend is encrypted via **HTTPS/TLS**.  
Render maintains industry-standard security practices for data in transit and at rest.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect improvements in our systems or compliance requirements.  
Updates will be dated and published on this same page.
